# generator-rusic-theme
> A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator to build base Rusic themes.


## Getting Started

  git clone git@github.com:rusic/generator-rusic-theme.git
  npm install -g ./

> We're not on npm (yet). To install run the above commands.

  mkdir rusic-theme-forum
  cd rusic-theme-forum
  yo rusic-theme

> Run the above to initiate the generator

It will then ask you a few questions, here are a few customisations you can make

- coffeescript or javascript
- scss or css
- API key setup

It also sets up a nice workflow with gulp :)
